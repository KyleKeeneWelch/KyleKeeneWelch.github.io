            <h2>Summary</h2>
            <p>
                This is a project that involves a web application created with the popular <span>Django</span>
                framework. It accomodates a series of topics for E-learning to be consumed by users of which personas
                will differ based on educational history and goals. Using the <span>MVT</span> (Model, View, Template)
                pattern as well as <span>Python</span> for the back-end logic, the web application will incorporate user
                interactivity and database connectivity to deliver an effective user and learning experience.
            </p>
            <p>
                The app will be named <span>Topedia</span> and encapsulates the idea of several topics to have
                self-contained topic rooms discussing various subjects and providing learning material about the parent
                concept. It will involve several pages of which will enable a user to login to add their own topics or
                learning material, leave comments and collaborate with other users or view without a login with
                restricted access. There will also be a filter by which a user can use to search or filter out the
                resources that appear to them, to target what the user wants to learn, and to display resources which
                will be beneficial to learning a particular subject. The ecosystem of resources will allow multimedia
                such as image and video as well as text for the user to customize how they want to teach their material
                to users.
            </p>
            <p>
                The <span>Django templating engine</span> will be used to form templates of static files that are
                dynamically displayed by <span>views</span>. <span>Views</span> are reached through the assigned URL
                that the user enters into their address bar or automatically through links in other pages.
                <span>Models</span> provide the data structure for entities and interactivity to the database that can
                be used alongside views to generate application logic. These will represent the attributes to objects
                such as a <span>User</span>, <span>Message</span> or <span>Room</span>.
            </p>

            <h2>Features</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>MVT and Database Connectivity</strong> - The MVT pattern allows the developer to separate
                    the different components of the application so that it is easy to insert, modfiy and understand the
                    code. Templates are generally what the user sees through the rendering of HTML pages with CSS and JS
                    included. Views house the application logic and processing of HTTP POST and GET requests. Models
                    represent entities and define the data structure and attributes of objects in the application. The
                    database connects to the models to create the necessary tables and commands to reflect the structure
                    and attributes provided. These are done in the form of migrations and need to be updated as changes
                    are made.
                </li>
                <li><strong>Login and Register Capabilities</strong> - Users are able to create their own account
                    and login free with Topedia to create their own topics and learning material. They are also able
                    to collaborate with other users by following, favouriting topic rooms and commenting. If a user
                    does not want to benefit from these features, they can access topic rooms without having an
                    account with limited functionality with how they can interact.
                </li>
                <li><strong>Filter of topics and produced results</strong> - Found at the top of every page, the
                    user can enter input into the search bar to receive topic room results related to the provided
                    input. This means a user can target the content they receive by applying a filter through a
                    search result or by browsing and selecting a topic to limit results to.
                </li>
                <li><strong>CRUD operations on created learning material and topics</strong> - Created objects such
                    as learning material and topics have the ability to be created, read, updated and deleted. These
                    allow the user to control the content they create and to make appropriate modifications to suit
                    their goals. Other objects like messages, user following and favourties can be created and
                    deleted / removed.
                </li>
                <li><strong>Cascade deletion of comments, learning material, topics and multimedia</strong> - To
                    ensure application storage and structure is maintained, many model objects and user uploaded
                    content is removed upon the deletion of linked objects. This is known as cascade deletion and is
                    a popular method used within the database to ensure and the content included is linked and no
                    anomalies are hidden clogging space and structure.
                </li>
                <li><strong>Profile Picture Modification</strong> - A user with a newly registered account will have
                    their profile picture set as the default anonymous image. Users are able to update this by
                    selecting an image from their files.
                </li>
            </ul>

                    Topedia has login and registration capabilities as well as the ability for unregistered users to
                    view site content with restricted interaction. The <span>login</span> page can be easily accessed
                    with the
                    login link found in the navbar when there is no user detected as logged in. From here a user can
                    enter their registered credentials or can press the sign up link to reach the register page.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The <span>register</span> page contains all the optional and required fields for a user to create a
                    new account with Topedia. Upon account creation, a session key will be generated and the logged in
                    user authenticated and managed by Django. A <span>user following</span> and <span>favourites</span>
                    object is also created and assigned to the new user.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Users can reach the settings page in the dropdown on the navbar and can make changes to their
                    account such as updating their password.

                    previously created room. The <span>create topic room</span> page will ask for the topic, name and
                    description of the new topic room. The topic can be chosen through the dropdown on the right side of
                    the field or alternatively, a new topic can be created by providing input into the field. The name
                    and description are displayed within the topic room page.

                    The <span>topics</span> and <span>recent activity</span> components are reused throughout different
                    parts of the web application. On the <span>home</span> page, you can select the first few topics and
                    by selecting a topic, you update the page to include filtered results. By pressing on more, you can
                    reach the standalone topics page which displays more topics and a search feature.

                <p>
                    The <span>recent activity</span> displays the most recent comments made on topic rooms within the
                    web application. You are able to view a <span>user's profile</span> and the <span>topic room</span>
                    the conversation is in. Both of these components can be viewed as part of their own page on the
                    mobile version of the home page, which provides links to these instead of displaying them.

                    The <span>following</span> and <span>favourites</span> pages are special pages that provide the
                    output for the following and favourites functionality. A user has an assigned object that stores the
                    users and rooms that the user follows and favourites. This object is then read and the appropriate
                    content is displayed in the <span>following</span> and <span>favourites</span> page. A user is able
                    to follow another user through the button displayed on their profile. This button is omitted on
                    their own profile to prevent following the logged in user. However, functionality allows a user to
                    favourite their own rooms if they so wish. The following functionality allows a user to collaborate
                    with other users who they have a certain fondness with and to assess and use this list how they see
                    fit. The favourites functionality allows the user to bookmark and compile of list of their favourite
                    topic rooms so that they can visit in the future.

                    <pre>
                        <code>

                    The implementation of Topedia included the series of dynamically displayed templates to the user.
                    These templates have their own hierachy by which the main template is included as part of many other
                    templates for redundant, core content. Within the <span>main</span> template, we include the
                    <span>navbar</span>, <span>flash messages</span>, <span>block tags</span> and links to the
                    javascript file for site interactivity.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The <span>navbar</span>, as the name suggests, is a HTML document which describes the structure of

                    The routes users could take where defined through the <span>url.py</span> files in the application.
                    The <span>main url</span> file contains the main type of routes that a user will take to reach
                    completely different areas. These include the <span>admin panel</span> for site administrators, an
                    empty path to include app specific routes and the routes to the created API.

                <p>
                    The app routes are stored within the "base" app <span>url.py</span> file. These are included and are
                    looked upon when the user provides a route not prepending admin or API and normally provide access
                    to the vast majority of app related routes. When the user has provided a URL that matches a path
                    defined in the <span>url file</span>, the linked <span>view</span> is run and if additional
                    arguments are provided, these are passed to the parameters of the <span>view</span>. The "name"
                    attribute is used as a relative reference in development so that if changes need to be made, only
                    the absolute URL needs to be updated to reflect the changes instead of all instances that use the

                    The implementation process also included the use of a defined theme with <span>colour
                        variables</span>, <span>font assignment</span> and other details to structure and present areas
                    of the application consistently and effectively. The <span>colour variables</span> provide a set of
                    colours that we reference throughout our application for a series of assigned reasoning. Such as
                    <span>color-main</span> as the main colour of the theme, <span>color-gray</span> for placeholder
                    text and areas with less importance and variables such as <span>color-success</span> and
                    <span>color-error</span> for successful and failure actions. Assigning the font and backup fonts
                    makes it easy when styling elements where the font is the same and reduces redundant styles. This is
                    also a similar case for other areas of the theme.

                    Topedia also has an API generated as part of the web application. This can be used from external
                    origins that wish to access the rooms or a single room available on the app. To access the API, we
                    use the "/api/" level after the <span>base URL</span> and then append the required value. Appending
                    nothing onto the URL will return a response with a list of the available routes the API provides.
                    Appending "rooms" will return a response with the serialized rooms that exists within the web
                    application. Appending "rooms/{value}" will return a response with the serialized room if it exists.

                    As an E-Learning collaborative solution, Topedia allows the use of user content to teach users. It
                    expresses the value of user generated content and enforces this throughout the site for users to
                    access and consume. To handle user content, we have the object that stores the reference to the
                    uploaded content and the actual uploaded content.
                <p>
                    The object is the <span>model</span> attribute field that stores the reference value of the content.
                    Such as the <span>image</span> attribute as part of the <span>LearningMaterial</span> model.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The actual uploaded content is stored within the media folder in the application directory. The
                    process in storing and accessing content in this folder involves the use of the
                    <span>MEDIA_URL</span> and <span>MEDIA_ROOT</span>. These are used to specify the default path the
                    application should take when multimedia content is uploaded through model fields.

                    There are several instances in which Topedia uses <span>ModelForms</span> to generate much of the
                    application form fields from the selected <span>model</span>. This works by assigning an imported
                    <span>model</span> from your <span>models.py</span> file to the <span>ModelForm</span>, selecting
                    the fields you want to include from the attributes in the <span>model</span> and if necessary, any
                    you wish to exclude.

                <p>
                    When displaying a <span>ModelForm</span> in a template, we would have already passed in the
                    <span>ModelForm</span> as part of a context dictionary into the template and we can access this
                    using a for loop. By looping through each field in the <span>ModelForm</span>, we can display each
                    label and field content without the need to define each field, therefore abstracting the process.

                    Django as a backend framework handles much of the authentication and administration for us. This is
                    useful however limits some of the customization and additional features when the developer does not
                    have the control. Topedia required certain attributes and preference on login that the Django User
                    Model did not satisfy. As this was the case, a <span>Custom User Model</span> was created which uses
                    similar functions as the <span>Django User Model</span> but with changes. The <span>Custom User
                        Model</span> now includes <span>bio</span> and <span>avatar</span> attributes and the
                    <span>USERNAME_FIELD</span> is assigned to the <span>email</span> attribute, therefore allowing
                    users to login through email rather than username.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Using a <span>Custom User Model</span> creates some complications in the admin panel when performing
                    site administration. In order to register and see the fields in your <span>Custom User Model</span>,
                    it was required to use a <span>Custom User Admin</span>. This provided similar functions to the
                    <span>User Admin</span> provided with the <span>Django User Model</span> but allows you to edit and
                    apply your own fieldsets.

                    When designing the web application, it was important alongside other important tasks to define some

                    can be used to evaluate the performance of our implementation. These <span>test cases</span> did not

                    <span>forms</span>, <span>models</span> and <span>views</span>. A <span>test case</span> can be
                    defined, required input emulated to recreate the same scenario and a summary can be produced to
                    identify where results differed from the expected and the changes that need to be made in the
                    debugging stage.
