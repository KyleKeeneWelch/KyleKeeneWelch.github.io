            <h2>Summary</h2>
            <p>
                This project is a project undertaken as part of <span>The Odin Project</span> learning web course
                teaching <span>HTML</span>, <span>CSS</span> and <span>JavaScript</span> skills. It involved putting
                into practice the teachings of <span>JavaScript</span> taught in the previous lessons and required the
                active use of research and preparation to find the correct JavaScript methods to use.
            </p>
            <p>
                The use of JavaScript is highly introduced within this project to demonstrate my skills in DOM methods
                and the manipulation of <span>HTML</span> and <span>CSS</span> from <span>JavaScript</span>.
                Etch-a-Sketch aims to provide a simple drawing application that enables the user to adjust the canvas
                size, select a colour, clear and erase drawn areas. Through the use of <span>event listeners</span> and
                <span>element ID</span>s, the project is capable of assessing whether the user has clicked onto the
                canvas and if the user drags their cursor over canvas cells. It would be the functions triggered by the
                event listeners that enable the interaction with the page such as changing the cell background colour.
            </p>
            <p>
                The buttons that enable the user to manipulate the canvas in Etch-a-Sketch are contained within a
                toolbar within several tabs. Tab labels are shown above each tab and consist of colour, mode, tool and
                layout tabs. Toolbar tabs use the wrap style within the flexwrap property which enable them to snap to
                multiline when there is not enough space on smaller screen sizes. The canvas size also shrinks and
                centers itself based upon the width of the device.
            </p>

            <h2>Features</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Responsive User Interface</strong> - The project provides a responsive user interface that
                    enables the same experience across both mobile and desktop devices. Elements in the toolbar contain
                    the wrap styling to drop to multiple lines if space does not occupy them on the same line. The
                    canvas size is decreased and centered to appear in the correct manner on smaller devices.</li>
                <li><strong>Adjustable Canvas Sizes</strong> - The canvas itself can have its grid adjusted so that the
                    number of cells that occupy the same space are altered. This means that the user can have more
                    detail in their drawing and can adjust this setting to suit their needs.</li>
                <li><strong>Range of colours</strong> - The project allows the use of a range of colours to draw on the
                    canvas. This can be manipulated through the colour input on the toolbar which when clicked, will
                    show a box which allows the user to drag the pointer to the colour they like. Upon the change, the
                    new colour is set as the current colour and this is the colour used when drawing on the canvas.</li>
                <li><strong>Different Modes</strong> - The user is able to select between draw and erase mode. The mode
                    currently selected is shown through the active class which changes the active mode button's
                    background colour. Draw mode which apply the current colour to the cells the user drags the mouse
                    over. Erase mode will return these cells to their original colour, erasing them from the drawing.
                </li>
                <li><strong>Scalable design and features</strong> - As a simple drawing application, Etch-a-Sketch has
                    capabilities to improve with more features and its scalable design. There is space on the toolbar
                    and space around the canvas for further tools, features and elements and so offers opportunities for
                    expansion.
                </li>
                <li><strong>Toggle Guidelines</strong> - An extra feature included is the use of guidelines which can be
                    toggled with the guidelines button. These will apply a light grey border to all cells in the canvas
                    which make it easier to see the ends of the individual pixels and to draw with more accuracy. Like
                    the mode buttons, when enabled, the button will show a different background colour. The button can
                    be clicked again to turn the guidelines off.
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Implementation</h2>
            <div>
                <h3>References to Elements</h3>
                <figure>
                    <pre>
                        <code>
// References to elements in the page.
const gridContainer = document.querySelector('.grid-container');
const cellSlider = document.querySelector('#cell-slider');
const sizeText = document.querySelector('#size-text');
const clearBtn = document.querySelector('#clear-btn');
const chooseColour = document.querySelector('#choose-colour');
const drawBtn = document.querySelector('#draw-btn');
const eraseBtn = document.querySelector('#erase-btn');
const guidelinesBtn = document.querySelector('#guidelines-btn');
                        </code>
                    </pre>
                </figure>
                <p>
                    A key area in implementing the JavaScript in the project is to use references to elements in the
                    page. These are variables that store the query results of certain element classes and IDs.
                    <span>SelectionButtons</span> is the only instance that uses the <span>querySelectorAll</span>
                    function which will return several elements within a <span>nodelist</span> to be accessed by the
                    variable. The <span>querySelector</span> function will return only one upon success. These variables
                    can be placed at the top of the script and can be accessed within <span>DOM methods</span> which
                    will manipulate the text content and styling of the referenced elements when required. This makes it
                    easier to access and less redundant that making references to the same element in several locations.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h3>Constant and Let values</h3>
                <figure>
                    <pre>
                        <code>
// Constant values for default state.
const DEFAULT_COLOR = '#333333';
const DEFAULT_SIZE = 16;
const DEFAULT_MODE = 'draw';
const DEFAULT_HAS_GLINES = false;

// Let values for dynamic state.
let currentSize = DEFAULT_SIZE;
let isMouseDown = false;
let currentMode = DEFAULT_MODE;
let currentColour = DEFAULT_COLOR;
let hasGuidelines = DEFAULT_HAS_GLINES;
                        </code>
                    </pre>
                </figure>
                <p>
                    Within the implementation, <span>constants</span> are used to define default values for several
                    properties of the application such as the colour, canvas size and mode. The use of
                    <span>constants</span> allows us to not accidently change static values and to apply these as the
                    starting values of the dynamic <span>let</span> variables below. These are changed upon user
                    interaction and do not affect the default values set by the <span>constants</span>.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h3>Using Event Listeners</h3>
                <figure>
                    <pre>
                        <code>
// Event listeners.
cellSlider.onmousemove = (e) => updateSizeText(e.target.value);
cellSlider.onchange = (e) => changeSize(e.target.value);
clearBtn.onclick = () => reloadGrid();
chooseColour.oninput = (e) => setCurrentColour(e.target.value);
drawBtn.onclick = () => setCurrentMode('draw');
eraseBtn.onclick = () => setCurrentMode('erase');
guidelinesBtn.onclick = () => setGuidelines();
document.body.onmousedown = () => (isMouseDown = true);
document.body.onmouseup = () => (isMouseDown = false);
                        </code>
                    </pre>
                </figure>
                <p>
                    In order to provide the interactivity of the JavaScript script <span>event listeners</span> were
                    used. These would pick up an assigned event to elements in the page such as the <span>click</span>
                    event to the toolbar buttons. Once a click was detected, the script would run the function provided
                    with the assignment of the listener and would place the event as the argument. This would provide
                    reference to the element clicked and could be used to access attributes such as the element's class
                    or ID. In one of the examples provided, we check for whether the slider has been moved by the mouse
                    and once they let go to set the change. From this, the <span>updateSizeText</span> function is run
                    with the value of the slider to show the current size and the current size is changed with the
                    <span>changeSize</span> function.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h3>Maintaining the Grid</h3>
                <figure>
                    <pre>
                        <code>
// Clears the grid.
function clearGrid() {
    gridContainer.innerHTML = '';
    setGuidelines();
}

// Reloads the grid (clears and recreate).
function reloadGrid() {
    clearGrid();
    makeGrid(currentSize);
}

// Creates the grid with the associated size.
function makeGrid(size) {
    gridContainer.style.gridTemplateColumns = `repeat(${size}, 1fr)`;
    gridContainer.style.gridTemplateRows = `repeat(${size}, 1fr)`;

    for (i = 0; i < (size * size); i++) {
        const cell = document.createElement("div");
        cell.addEventListener('mouseover', changeColour);
        cell.addEventListener('mousedown', changeColour);
        gridContainer.appendChild(cell).className = "grid-item";
    };
};
                        </code>
                    </pre>
                </figure>
                <p>
                    Another key concept in the implementation of the JavaScript interactivity in the page is the
                    maintaining of the grid. This involves making the grid on load, reloading the grid and clearing it.
                    The grid in this instance refers to the canvas on the page. This is generated using the
                    <span>gridTemplateColumns</span> and <span>gridTemplateRows</span> properties and applying repeat
                    values of the assigned size to create several equal size cells. Applying the same size to both the
                    column and row property means JavaScript will generate the grid-like display and this is effective
                    to be used as the canvas. Each cell is applied the <span>mouseover</span> and <span>mousedown</span>
                    event listeners which will change the background colour of the target cell if applicable. These
                    cells are then appended to the <span>gridContainer</span> so they form a main parent with several
                    children.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h3>ClassList and the Active Class</h3>
                <figure>
                    <pre>
                        <code>
// Sets the active button.
function setActiveButton(mode) {
    if (currentMode === 'draw') {
        drawBtn.classList.remove('active');
    }
    else if (currentMode === 'erase') {
        eraseBtn.classList.remove('active');
    }

    if (mode === 'draw') {
        drawBtn.classList.add('active');
    }
    else if (mode === 'erase') {
        eraseBtn.classList.add('active');
    }
}
                        </code>
                    </pre>
                </figure>
                <p>
                    The use of <span>classList</span> in the implementation allows the toolbar buttons to display
                    different styling to those that are in an active state compared to inactive. By defining a different
                    background colour to an active class, we can assign this class using <span>classList.add</span> and
                    remove this with <span>classList.remove</span> to apply the active styling when a certain mode is
                    enabled or the guidelines are set.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h3>Changing Colour</h3>
                <figure>
                    <pre>
                        <code>
// Changes the assigned colour or enables eraser.
function changeColour(e) {
    if (e.type === 'mouseover' && !isMouseDown) return
    if (currentMode === 'draw') {
        e.target.style.backgroundColor = currentColour
    }
    else if (currentMode === 'erase') {
        e.target.style.backgroundColor = '#fefefe';
    }
}
                        </code>
                    </pre>
                </figure>
                <p>
                    When we want to implement the draw functionality to the canvas, we can use the
                    <span>changeColour</span> function to do this. This function will check whether the passed in event
                    is of type mouseover and uses the <span>isMouseDown</span> function to check whether the mouse is
                    down. We want to ensure the canvas is drawn upon when the user clicks and drags over a segment.
                    Therefore, we have to check whether the mouse is over and down before changing the colour of a cell
                    to implement this behaviour. When this is the case, we also check what mode we are currently on. If
                    the mode is draw, then we will change the background colour of the targeted cell to the current
                    colour. Otherwise if the mode is erase, we will change the background colour of the targeted cell to
                    the original colour, erasing it from the drawing.
