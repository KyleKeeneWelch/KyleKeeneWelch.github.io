            <h2>Summary</h2>
            <p>
                This project is one component part of a larger Scalable, Reusable, Microservices architecture. It was
                developed in my Final Year Thesis as experimentation for the enhanced user interaction and experience
                applied from using the architecture for a business workflow. The demonstrated application was a Book
                Ratings and Reviews site that used the Event Sourcing System to define events, projections, and apply
                functions relating to Book Recommendations.
            </p>
            <p>
                The component comprises of a core domain and business defined domains which feed off this reusable
                functionality. Modules include:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>API</strong> - API boilerplate that serve functionality to initialise the server and JWT
                    authentication without defining the routes.</li>
                <li><strong>CommandHandling</strong> - Containing exported functions for the create and update commands
                    in the business's write model. These enable the application to implicitly create or append to a
                    stream without defining the handler.</li>
                <li><strong>HTTP</strong> - Containing exported functions to do with formatting and retrieving an ETag
                    value from the If Match header for revisions.</li>
                <li><strong>MongoDB</strong> - Containing exported functions for connecting to a local MongoDB database,
                    retrieving collections, making assertions, and loading and storing checkpoints.</li>
                <li><strong>Retries</strong> - Containing exported functions for retrying failed operations to the
                    database based off the understanding that latency exists between reading your writes (Eventual
                    Consistency).</li>
                <li><strong>Streams</strong> - Containing the connection to the event store and the Stream Aggregator to
                    aggregate through events to form a current state.</li>
                <li><strong>Subscriptions</strong> - Containing exported functions for setting up subscriptions with the
                    event store to notify the system when an event has been successfully appended so that the current
                    state can be rebuilt and changes can be reflected on business defined projections.</li>
                <li><strong>Validation</strong> - Containing functions to validate input passed in from events generated
                    by the user.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h2>Features</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Book</strong> - Containing a domain interface book and several functions for the business
                    logic relating to the event handlers applied to retrieve the current state.
                </li>
                <li><strong>BookRecommendationDetails</strong> - The projections relating to the book recommendations
                    which include functions that check for the event being aggregated, will run the projection function
                    relating to the event type and altering the projection database to reflect the new state from
                    changes to the previous.</li>
                <li><strong>BookRecommendations</strong> - This module maintains all the event types and functions
                    relating to the events in the book recommendations domain.</li>
                <li><strong>Routes</strong> - Defines the endpoints for the back-end API to access to pass data in and
                    process these as events before appending to the event store. Required routes will include POST
                    routes for creating a recommendation, adding a view-book event, adding a like-book event, adding a
                    unlike-book event, and adding a rate-book event. It also defines endpoints for retrieving the state
                    in the projection database such as the GET route for getting the recommendation.</li>
            </ul>

                <p>
                    <span>Apply Functions </span>define the business logic that modifies the current state in an
                    aggregation of
                    events. The Business defines an Apply Function to transform the data upon receiving each event in
                    the aggregation of events in a stream. The provided code is of an apply function that will alter the
                    recommendation by shifting the book categories to include the categories of the book the user has
                    viewed in the event.
