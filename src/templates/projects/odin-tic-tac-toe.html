            <h2>Summary</h2>
            <p>
                This project is a project undertaken as part of <span>The Odin Project</span> learning web course
                teaching <span>HTML</span>, <span>CSS</span> and <span>JavaScript</span> skills. It involved putting
                into practice the teachings of <span>Factory Functions</span> and <span>IIFEs</span> taught in the
                previous lessons to create effective data structures and organized code.
            </p>
            <p>
                The project aims to emulate the popular Tic-Tac-Toe game for two players. It involves display and game
                elements which will show current game output and process user input to update the state of the game.
                Through the use of <span>factory functions</span> and <span>IIFE</span>s we can create application
                objects upon the script running in the browser which allows us to prepare the page to receive and handle
                player input.
            </p>
            <p>
                Much of the data is handled through an Object-Oriented approach in JavaScript but applies <span>factory
                    functions</span> as the take on creating objects instead of the popular use of
                <span>constructors</span>. <span>Factory functions</span> enable the developer to return only the
                properties and functions that they want to be publicly accessed and to essentially hide the rest.
                Returned public elements still have access to private, hidden elements in the object and this enforces
                the concept of <span>closure</span>. We prevent errors and allow for easier debugging and modification
                of code by using <span>Factory functions</span> this way.

            <h2>Features</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Two Player</strong> - Provides support for two players to play the game each with there own
                    sign. Rounds alternate meaning it is the other player's go once a field has been selected and a sign
                    placed.</li>
                <li><strong>Outcome Modal</strong> - After each round played, the application will check the winning
                    combinations to see if the current player has three consecutive signs in each of the field's indexs.
                    The outcome is displayed within a modal shown to the user at the center of the screen alongside a
                    restart button.</li>
                <li><strong>Draws</strong> -If no player is able to receive a winning combination after 9 rounds, then
                    the outcome modal is displayed with text declaring the game a draw.</li>
            </ul>
            <div class="project-feature-container">
                <h3>Starting State</h3>
                <img src=<%=require("../../assets/images/projects/odin-tic-tac-toe/starting_state_tic_tac_toe.png")%>
                alt="Starting State"
                />
                <p>
                    The user interface upon start consists of a header, footer, start message and start button. The user
                    is prompted to press the start button before the game starts and this will allow the application to
                    show game elements.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="project-feature-container">
                <h3>Grid Structure</h3>

                alt="Grid Structure"
                />
                <p>
                    Grid is used to create the game board and to assign the array elements to each field to represent
                    the current state of the game.
                </p>

                alt="Outcome Modal"
                />
                <p>The outcome modal is a popup that appears at the center of the screen alongside an overlay that
                    places emphasis on the center. Depending on the outcome of the game, the modal will display a
                    different message. Either Player X has won, Player O or a draw. This is followed by a restart button
                    that resets the display and game elements.</p>

                    <pre>
                        <code>
// Keep track of grid array and set and get array fields.
const GameGrid = (() => {
    const grid = ['', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', ''];

    const setField = (index, sign) => {
        if (index > grid.length) return;
        grid[index] = sign;
        };
    
        const getField = (index) => {
        if (index > grid.length) return;
        return grid[index];
        };
    
        const restart = () => {
        for (let i = 0; i < grid.length; i++) {
            grid[i] = '';
        }
        }

        return {setField, getField, restart};
})();

                <p>
                    <span>IIFE</span>s are known as Immediately Invoked Function Expressions and these, as the name
                    suggests, are functions that run immediately within the script. These allow for developers to
                    specify functionality that they want to make effect immediately upon the page loading. In this case,
                    we want to have our objects created and our event listeners assigned upon the page loading so the
                    user play the game without additional setup.
                </p>

                <h3>Factory Functions</h3>
                <figure>
                    <pre>
                        <code>
// Assign X or O to player.
const Player = (sign) => {
    const _sign = sign;

    const getSign = () => {
        return _sign
    }

    return {getSign};
};
                        </code>

                </figure>
                <p>
                    We use <span>Factory functions</span> within the implementation of this project as an alternative to
                    <span>constructors</span> and to enforce <span>closure</span>. With constructors, we pass in values
                    and use the <span>new</span> keyword to instantiate an object with the values assigned as
                    properties. Any methods defined within the object are accessible from the new object. Factory
                    functions instead have values assigned and only the properties and methods that we want to be
                    accessed publicly are returned. Public functions can still access private properties and methods as
                    they belong within the same scope. We use this concept of closure to define private and public
                    functions and properties to assist in debugging, reducing errors and better organizing code. In this
                    case, we use a factory function to define a new Player object. This object will return the
                    <span>getSign()</span> function therefore making it publicly accessible.

                    The implementation makes use of root variables and default styling to improve the development
                    process and the quality of code. Root variables allow us to specify the website's theme and the
                    colours we wish to use in different areas. By specifying the variable name, we can reference the
                    colour and can apply this to element's <span>color</span> and <span>background-color</span>
                    properties. Default styling is styling applied to all elements to provide a base style that can be
                    inherited by each element. This includes setting the box-sizing, setting the margin and padding to 0
                    and other things such as the font-family and size.

                    winning combinations of indexes which represent the location of each of the fields in the game. We
                    then use filter to return only true combinations that meet the following conditions: If a
                    combination has the index of the field the user has selected, then using some to return true if at
                    least one combination meets the following condition: If each index contains the current player's
                    sign for each index in the possible combination. We use <span>.every()</span> to make sure every
                    index contains the sign. If a winning combination is found then true is returned and the application
                    will run additional functions to handle end game state.

                    We use event listeners and DOM methods in our user interface implementation to allow us to detect
                    when the user has performed a specific event and to provide an appropriate response. The "click"
                    event on the start and restart buttons allow us to detect whether a user has pressed the buttons and
                    to handle starting or restarting the game through the relevant executed code that follows. The
                    "click" event assigned to each field in the grid will play a round of the game if the field doesn't
                    already have a sign within or the game is not over.
