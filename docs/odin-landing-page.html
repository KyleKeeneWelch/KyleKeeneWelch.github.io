            <h2>Summary</h2>
            <p>
                This project is a project undertaken as part of <span>The Odin Project</span> learning web course
                teaching <span>HTML</span>, <span>CSS</span> and <span>JavaScript</span> skills. It involved putting
                into practice the teachings of <span>HTML</span> and <span>CSS</span> covered in the previous lessons
                while also incorporating my own ideas and outside knowledge. <strong>The Business and Products shown are
                    intended for learning and demonstration purposes of web skills and do not provide marketing or
                    rights of the content shown</strong>.
            </p>
            <p>
                This project enabled me to create a landing (`product`) page of a new product for a business. Other
                pages included the <span>sign up</span> and <span>contact</span> pages which allowed users to sign up to
                the newsletter and contact the team. Each page provided a consistent navigation bar and footer. The
                navigation bar was responsive and switched to provide a burger menu on mobile and small screens.
            </p>
            <p>
                The product page provided a simple flexbox layout and responsive design with product images, blockquote
                and links to the sign up page. The <span>sign up</span> page advertised for upcoming products by the
                business and placed ideas of mock-up products to entice the user to sign up. To sign up, a form is
                provided with fields including the user's name, email, contact number and checkboxes for preferred
                contact methods. Much like the <span>sign up</span> page, the <span>contact</span> page provides a
                contact form to get in touch with the business and image links allow users to redirect to the business's
                social media profiles.
            </p>
            <p>
                In the backend, <span>PHP</span> is used with <span>XAMPP</span> to provide a local server to be used to
                process the form values. The sign up script will validate and clean sign up form values and if valid,
                will write these to a text file named newsletter.text. The contact script will validate and clean
                contact form values and will send an automatic email with the mail function to a set address.
            </p>

            <h2>Features</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Responsive Design</strong> - Utilizing media queries, flexbox and relative values, the
                    project is able to control the display of included content to fit all viewport sizes and devices.
                    The site has a desktop design which will express containers, images and text in a manner that makes
                    use of space appropriately and draws in users. It also has intermediate and mobile designs which
                    will display content to keep it within boundaries and allowing it to be consumed in its new
                    dimensions.</li>
                <li><strong>Consistent use of Colour, Font and Styles</strong> - Each page within the project contains
                    the same theme and styles that carry over from the last page. The user is easily able to tell which
                    containers provide content, which include form fields, which elements were links, buttons and more.
                    The font is displayed big and bold for headings and important information and the colour scheme
                    provides an attractive look for the site and encourages reading of the business's product.</li>
                <li><strong>Newsletter</strong> - An additional feature not part of The Odin Project was the inclusion
                    of a basic newsletter. The newsletter will be in the form of a text file which contains user's who
                    have signed up, their contact information and their preferred contact method(s). These could be used
                    by the business to alert signed up users to new products and services. The newsletter text file is
                    appended to through the backend processing of the sign up form through PHP.</li>
                <li><strong>Automatic Email</strong> - Provides a session log to see what workouts you have done
                    and when and for how long they lasted. Also provides performance graphs which graphically show your
                    progress on various areas.</li>
                <li><strong>Unplanned and Pre-built Workouts</strong> - Another great feature is the use of the mail
                    function to automatically email a correspondant at the business. This provides back-end processing
                    to the contact form which will clean and validate the input and automatically fill in the email
                    components. Once the message has been constructed dynamically from the fields, this is placed and
                    sent to the correct address.
                </li>
            </ul>

                <p>
                    This page provides the main product that the landing page promotes. It provides a large product
                    image
                    and header and displays its benefits in a delightful manner. The page also contains a testimony
                    which
                    displays the user with a good review. Links to the <span>sign up</span> page are also provided in a
                    container with a button.

                />
                <p>
                    Within this page, there are several upcoming products that are contained within their own sections
                    which provides the name, description of the product and a link to the following sign up form to sign
                    up to hear more. The sign up form provides fields such as the name, email, contact number, and
                    preferred contact method(s) and a submit button. Providing valid input will add the user to the
                    newsletter. Duplicate names become invalid.

                <p>
                    The <span>contact page</span> is a page that contains the contact form and image links to the
                    business's social media profiles. The contact form contains fields such as name, email, message and
                    a submit button which will validate, clean and will place user input into an email sent
                    automatically to the correct address.

                <p>
                    The project maintains a consistent responsive design across all its pages. This allows users from a
                    range of devices and browsers to view and access the content.

            <h2>Implementation</h2>
            <div>
                <h3>Responsive Menu</h3>
                <figure>
                    <pre>
                        <code>
&lt;div class=&quot;topnav&quot; id=&quot;myTopnav&quot;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&quot;javascript:void(0);&quot; class=&quot;icon&quot; onclick=&quot;ResponsiveMenu()&quot;&gt;&#9776;&lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;a href=&quot;index.html&quot;&gt;Product&lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;a href=&quot;sign_up_page.php&quot;&gt;Sign Up&lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;a href=&quot;contact_page.php&quot;&gt;Contact&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

function ResponsiveMenu() {	
    //Create a reference to the element that holds the myTopNav Id.
    var x = document.getElementById("myTopnav");	
    //If the reference has a classname of topnav.			
    if (x.className === "topnav") {		
        //Add the classname responsive.			
        x.className += " responsive";				
    } else {    //If the class name already has the responsive name added on, switch it back to topnav.	
        x.className = "topnav";
    }
}
                        </code>
                    </pre>
                </figure>
                <p>
                    One great part of the implementation is the use of a responsive menu to offer both desktop, mobile
                    and intermediary devices a coherant experience. On desktop, you will observe that the navigation bar
                    contains both the business title and links stretched across the page. On mobile and devices between,
                    you will observe that the navigation bar changes the links to a single burger menu icon which upon
                    being pressed, will display the links as a block below. To do this, the project will assign class
                    names and removes class names depending on <span>viewport</span> size. A larger size will remove the
                    responsive classname which applies styles to show the links. A smaller size will add the responsive
                    class so that the links are not displayed and is replaced by the burger menu.

                <h3>Colour Variables and Base Styles</h3>
                <figure>
                    <pre>
                        <code>
/* Colour Variables */
:root {
--color-background: #1F2937;
--color-main: #F9FAF8;
--color-main-light: #E5E7EB;
--color-secondary: #3882F6;
}

/*========== base styles ==========*/

    "Helvetica Neue", sans-serif;

box-sizing: border-box;
text-rendering: optimizeLegibility;
font-size: inherit;
}

html {
font-size: 56.25%;
}
...
                        </code>
                    </pre>
                </figure>
                <p>
                    Another area of the implementation involves the use of <span>colour variables</span> and <span>base
                        styles</span>. These are used to simplify the styling process and remove redundant areas. By
                    defining <span>colour variables</span>, it is quicker and easier to reference the variable in the
                    right context of use to apply the style rather than set the colour manually. Plus, if we want to
                    change all instances of this colour, it is easier to change the variable and see the whole site
                    change rather than change every instance. By defining <span>base styles</span>, we can declare
                    default styling that is inherited across all elements. Where we want to define styling specific to
                    one element or a group, we can specify a selector more important than the base style, which is more
                    efficient and less redudant than specifying each style without inheritence.

                <h3>Media Queries</h3>
                <figure>
                    <pre>
                        <code>
@media screen and (max-width: 600px) {
    nav {
        display: block;
    }
...

@media screen and (max-width: 720px) {
    .benefits-container {
        display: block;
    }
...

@media only screen and (max-width: 1000px) {
    .hero-container {
        padding-left: 5%;
        padding-right: 5%;
        display: block;
        text-align: center;
...
                        </code>
                    </pre>
                </figure>
                <p>
                    A key concept in project implementation is the use of <span>media queries</span>. These detect
                    changes in the <span>viewport</span> size and depending on if the condition is met, will make
                    styling changes as long as it remains true. A popular method is to provide <span>viewport</span>
                    width checkpoints which will alter elements so that they are responsive in all devices from
                    desktops, iPads to mobiles.

                <p>
                    As explained, the newsletter will make use of the sign up form, and back-end functionality to write
                    to the newsletter file. To do this, the sign up form will contain labels and fields that prompt the
                    user for the required input. Error messages and previous values are displayed using PHP's
                    <span>echo</span> function upon refresh. The submittion from this form will be sent to the same
                    address and as the file requires the PHP script, this is run with the form values stored within the
                    <span>POST</span> object. The appropriate cleaning and validation is undergone and if no errors are
                    detected, the file is opened, read to check for a duplicate name, message formed from input and
                    written to, appending to the end of the file.

                    Mentioned before, the contact form will implement automatic email sending with a message dynamically
                    formed from cleaned user input. This is done through the contact form containing and prompting the
                    required fields to form an email with the desired message. Error messages and previous values are
                    displayed using PHP's <span>echo</span> function upon refresh. The submittion from this form will be
                    sent to the same address and as the file requires the PHP script, this is run with the form values
                    stored within the <span>POST</span> object. The appropriate cleaning and validation is undergone and
                    if no errors are detected, the message is constructed from user input and is sent to the correct
                    address.
