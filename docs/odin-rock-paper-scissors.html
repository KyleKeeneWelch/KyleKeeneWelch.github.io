            <h2>Summary</h2>
            <p>
                This project is a project undertaken as part of <span>The Odin Project</span> learning web course
                teaching <span>HTML</span>, <span>CSS</span> and <span>JavaScript</span> skills. It involved putting
                into practice the teachings of <span>JavaScript</span> taught in the previous lessons and built upon the
                previous console application version by implementing a fleshed out user interface and updated logic.
            </p>
            <p>
                The use of JavaScript is highly introduced within this project to demonstrate my skills in DOM methods
                and the manipulation of <span>HTML</span> and <span>CSS</span> from <span>JavaScript</span>. By
                understanding the rules of the typical rock, paper, scissors game, I am able to control conditional
                logic to assess whether the player's selected choice produces a winning, losing or drawn outcome when
                compared to a randomly selected choice by the computer. Much of the user interface elements are
                dynamically shown such as updating the score elements when the player or computer accumulates a point or
                is shown/hidden from the removal or addition of the class from an element's classlist.
            </p>
            <p>
                Hiding elements is manipulated as the added and removed class has styling properties set so an element's
                display attribute is none. This means we can only show elements on the interface to the user when they
                are required therefore reducing clutter and increasing user experience. This is used in a "game-like"
                fashion where the game introduction or menu is shown before the game content is displayed and a button
                to restart the game is shown upon finish.
            </p>

            <h2>Features</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Responsive User Interface</strong> - The project provides a responsive user interface that
                    enables the same experience across both mobile and desktop devices. Elements that are spread across
                    the screen are catered for in the mobile version of the site which drops these to maintain their own
                    spaces. Much of the elements found within the site use flexbox and justify content to center
                    themselves and negotiate their spacing between elements on the same row.</li>
                <li><strong>Replayable with different outcomes</strong> - The game itself contains a winning, losing and
                    draw state. The player can produce a winning outcome by reaching 5 points. The same applies to the
                    computer where the player would therefore lose. Getting a draw means that nobody receives a point
                    and therefore the outcome involves the continuation of another round until a win or loss is met.
                </li>
                <li><strong>Simple and Traditional</strong> - Users can find that the selection between a choice of
                    rock, paper, scissors to be easy from the large buttons representing each choice. The goal of the
                    game is clearly stated in the beginning and the selection of the player and the computer is shown as
                    well as the outcome of a round and eventually the game. The display of such information makes the
                    game simple to play and understand and much of the rules and scoring system are traditional of the
                    rock, paper, scissors game.</li>
                <li><strong>Image Buttons</strong> - To assist in the selection of a choice, each button contains an
                    image within which when clicked, will provide the same selected choice as the player's hand in the
                    game. This makes it easier to see which option is which and makes for a more refined and aesthetic
                    look.</li>
            </ul>
            <div class="project-feature-container">
                <h3>Start</h3>
                <img src=da4ae345f02f84a50416.png alt="Start
                phase of site"
                />
                <p>
                    The display shown upon reaching the site involves the title and challenge of rock, paper, scissors
                    first to 5. The button provided will be handled by the event handler in the click event where the
                    game elements will be shown and the rest hidden.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="project-feature-container">
                <h3>Game</h3>
                <img src=bfa547cdf706a5c7eaca.png alt="Game
                phase of site"
                />
                <p>
                    The game elements are shown and include the selection container with the choices, the choice
                    container, result container, score container with both scores and the winner container. The user
                    interface will update with each selected choice where a round win will increment the player's score,
                    a round loss will increment the computer's score and a draw will keep the scores. What the player
                    and the computer selected as well as the outcome of the round is displayed. Once somebody reaches 5
                    points, the winner is displayed and a choice can no longer be chosen. If the play again button is
                    clicked, the game is restarted and enables the player to select a choice.

            <h2>Implementation</h2>
            <div>
                <h3>Media Queries and Responsiveness</h3>
                <figure>
                    <pre>
                        <code>
@media only screen and (max-width: 1000px) {
    .container {
        display: block;
    }

    #selection-container {
        display: block;
        margin: auto;

        & div {
            display: block;
            margin: auto;
            margin-top: 20px;
        }
    }
}
                        </code>
                    </pre>
                </figure>
                <p>
                    To apply responsive elements within the site <span>media queries</span> where used. These define
                    styles to be applied when the <span>max-width</span> of the screen of the device used to view the
                    site reaches below 1000px. The styles applied included switching the <span>container</span> class
                    and <span>selection-container</span> ID to display <span>block</span> instead of <span>flex</span>.
                    This means the elements will stretch out and cover the available space instead of form rows/columns
                    in <span>flexbox</span>. The <span>div</span> elements of the <span>selection-container</span> will
                    also occupy a display <span>block</span> instead of <span>flex</span> so that they can split down
                    into a mobile-friendly column with space in the margin top so they are separated.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h3>References to elements</h3>
                <figure>
                    <pre>
                        <code>
// References to elements in page used in JS
const selectionButtons = document.querySelectorAll('#selection-container div > button');
const startBtn = document.querySelector('#start-btn');
const playAgainBtn = document.querySelector('#play-again-btn');
const scoreContainer = document.querySelector('#score-container');
const choiceContainer = document.querySelector('#choice-container');
...
                        </code>
                    </pre>
                </figure>
                <p>
                    A key area in implementing the JavaScript in the project is to use references to elements in the
                    page. These are variables that store the query results of certain element classes and IDs.
                    <span>SelectionButtons</span> is the only instance that uses the <span>querySelectorAll</span>
                    function which will return several elements within a <span>nodelist</span> to be accessed by the
                    variable. The <span>querySelector</span> function will return only one upon success. These variables
                    can be placed at the top of the script and can be accessed within <span>DOM methods</span> which
                    will manipulate the text content and styling of the referenced elements when required. This makes it
                    easier to access and less redundant that making references to the same element in several locations.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h3>Using Event Listeners</h3>
                <figure>
                    <pre>
                        <code>
selectionButtons.forEach((button) => {
    // If the button is clicked or the image in the button.
    button.addEventListener('click', (e) => {
        if (e.target.id == 'select-rock' || e.target.parentNode.id == 'select-rock') {
            playRound(0, getComputerChoice());
        }
        else if (e.target.id == 'select-paper' || e.target.parentNode.id == 'select-paper') {
            playRound(1, getComputerChoice());
        }
        else if (e.target.id == 'select-scissors' || e.target.parentNode.id == 'select-scissors') {
            playRound(2, getComputerChoice());
        }
    });
})
...
                        </code>
                    </pre>
                </figure>
                <p>
                    In order to provide the interactivity of the JavaScript script <span>event listeners</span> were
                    used. These would pick up an assigned event to elements in the page such as the <span>click</span>
                    event to the selection buttons. Once a click was detected, the script would run the anonymous
                    function provided with the assignment of the listener and would place the event as the argument.
                    This would provide reference to the element clicked and could be used to access attributes such as
                    the element's class or ID. In the example provided, we check for whether the returned element's ID
                    or the parent's ID is a choice in the game (the button or the image in the button) and passes the
                    choice as an argument to the playRound function.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h3>Text Content and ClassList</h3>
                <figure>
                    <pre>
                        <code>
// If there is a winner, display winner text and show play again button. Disable selection buttons as game is over.
if (playerScore.textContent == "5" || computerScore.textContent == "5") {
    if (playerScore.textContent == "5") {
        winText = document.createElement('p');
        winText.textContent = "Player Wins!"
        winnerContainer.prepend(winText);
    }
    else {
        winText = document.createElement('p');
        winText.textContent = "Computer Wins!"
        winnerContainer.prepend(winText);
    }

    playAgainBtn.classList.remove('hidden');

    selectionButtons.forEach((button) => {
        button.disabled = true;
    });
}
                        </code>
                    </pre>
                </figure>
                <p>
                    Another key concept in the implementation of the JavaScript interactivity in the page is the use of
                    the <span>text content</span> and <span>classList</span> attributes. These are attributes of the
                    referenced elements that are accessed in order to manipulate the text displayed to the user and the
                    styling applied. The class <span>hidden</span> is used to hide an element through display none or
                    show the element through the removal of the class. This is effective in JavaScript where we can add
                    or remove the class to referenced elements when they should no longer be seen or should be seen by
                    the player. Changing the <span>text content</span> in useful in updating the score in the game and
                    to provide dynamic output to the user such as what was played and the winner of the round.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h3>Random Numbers</h3>
                <figure>
                    <pre>
                        <code>
function getComputerChoice() {
    // Return random number between 0 and 2.
    return Math.floor(Math.random() * 3);
}
                        </code>
                    </pre>
                </figure>
                <p>
                    A final concept used in the JavaScript of the site is the use of random numbers to generate the
                    computer's choice to rock, paper, scissors. The function <span>getComputerChoice()</span> will
                    return a value that is between 0 and 2 inclusive. This is formed from the <span>Math.random</span>
                    function and the <span>Math.floor</span> function which will generate a value, multiply by 3 and
                    round this to an integer to form a value withint the correct range. This can be used to consistently
                    provide a random selection by the computer where the produced values represent the choices rock,
                    paper or scissors.
