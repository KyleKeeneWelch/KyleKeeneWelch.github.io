            <h2>Summary</h2>
            <p>
                This project was the first big step into becoming familiar with <span>Express</span> and Back-end
                development in preparation for my final year artefact. It follows the Mozilla Express Tutorial to
                develop a simple library application with <span>CRUD</span> operations on authors, books, genres and
                book instances.
            </p>
            <p>
                The project aims to familiarize myself with the concepts behind <span>templating languages</span>,
                <span>REST</span>, <span>models</span>, <span>views</span>, and <span>controllers</span> and presents a
                simple application to build proficiency in these areas to develop and be used in future projects. It
                also introduces <span>MongoDB</span> as a NoSQL langauge which was a new experience from traditional SQL
                table-based databases. Through the Object Data Modelling library <span>Mongoose</span>, I was able to
                define models with constraints that can easily map to collections in the database and could perform
                simple CRUD operations on these.
            </p>

            <p>
                As a result, the produced artefact contains a series of pages utilizing the templating engine to
                dynamically display content such as the selected book. Further implementations involving Express and
                MongoDB will build upon the concepts demonstrated in this project.
            </p>

            <h2>Features</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Server-Side Routing</strong> - Requests are processed by the server and the server uses
                    templates to dynamically respond with requested content.</li>
                <li><strong>CRUD Operations</strong> - Mongoose is used to perform create, read, update, and delete
                    operations on collections for entities such as authors, genres, books, and book instances.</li>
                <li><strong>MVC</strong> - Utilizes the common Model, View, Controller pattern to separate the concerns
                    between defined entities, templates and business logic for maintainability.</li>
                <li><strong>Mongo Atlas</strong> - Makes use of the cloud platform Mongo Atlas to modify collections and
                    return responses to queries on the database.</li>

            </ul>

                />
                <p>
                    The Home page provides a simple welcome message and record counts for the amount of books, copies,
                    available copies, authors and genres in the library.

                    Clicking on a link such as <span>All books</span> will serve the page containing a list of all the
                    books available in the library. The same can be done for other entities by clicking on the
                    corresponding link. Each page will include the relevant details and links that meet the requirements
                    of each entity. The Book Instances page contains special information for the availability of a
                    particular copy and when an unavailable copy is expected to be available again.

                    Submitting this would send a request to delete a book in the database. The same operation can be

                    Models are created using the Schema class provided by Mongoose. The provided code sets out the
