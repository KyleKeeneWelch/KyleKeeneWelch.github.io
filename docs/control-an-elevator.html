            <h2>Summary</h2>
            <p>
                This project uses <span>C#</span> and the popular <span>.NET framework</span> by Microsoft to
                simulate the actions and animation of an elevator.
            </p>
            <p>
                Using an <span>event driven approach</span>, a user will interact with a provided graphical user
                interface and will select the appropriate floor the elevator should go to. The program will respond
                through the various assigned delegates and event handlers to open and close the elevator doors, change
                the floor indicators, display the control panel and display the elevator “log”. Trips are stored within
                a <span>MSAccess database</span> and is accessed and updated using the command builder in the
                <span>Entity Framework</span>. Other great features include asynchronous operations using
                <span>background worker</span> and the use of the <spa>disconnected database model</spa>.
            </p>

            <h2>Features</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>MSAccess Database Connectivity</strong> - Application instantiates and populates an MSAccess
                    database and uses related Entity Framework functions to update and get changes to the data and
                    database schema so they are concurrent.</li>
                <li><strong>Disconnected Model</strong> - Application uses a local dataset that it changes in accordance
                    to the input from the user. This dataset is pushed forward and a commit to the database is made when
                    the user chooses to “save” from the save button instead of making a commit after each action. This
                    saves server processing time and reduces unnecessary overhead.</li>
                <li><strong>Asynchronous Operations</strong> - Utilizing background worker service to run select
                    operations on a separate thread. Allows user to continue to move the elevator between floors all
                    while saving or loading the log asynchronously.</li>
                <li><strong>Command Builder</strong> - Abstracts redundant command building processes through the use of
                    OleDB Command Builder. More focus is on application logic rather than connectivity and commands to
                    the database.</li>
                <li><strong>Paint Tools and Timer</strong> - Uses a timer that periodically checks the condition of the
                    elevator and refreshes the drawings of the doors in correspondance to the current condition. Creates
                    the “animation” effect through the redrawing of elevator doors in the correct location per frame.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <div class="project-feature-container">
                <h3>Elevator Idle</h3>
                <img src=9867f38f60806754f92d.png alt="Elevator
                Idle" />
                <p>
                    Here we can see the graphical user interface in its idle state. The floors, call buttons and panel
                    and the doors can be seen on the left. The elevator “log” or events can be seen on the right with
                    buttons to save, load, clear and delete trips. Finally an additional close button is provided
                    alternative to the one found on the window.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="project-feature-container">
                <h3>Elevator Moving</h3>
                <img src=e03b2a3657041310f1f9.png
                alt="Elevator Moving">
                <p>
                    When we have pressed a button to either call or move the elevator to a floor, the doors will open to
                    allow individuals to enter, close and then after a short pause, the process will repeat. The doors
                    will now however open on the destination floor and the floor indicators as well as the panel will
                    change to reflect this. The elevator events will also add the new trip.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="project-feature-container">

                <img src=62ab69f4eb1259290ede.png alt="Elevator
                Log Saved While Moving">
                <p>When we save we will asynchronously connect to the database and will commit the local dataset to the
                    data stored within the table. This means that we can still move our elevator to a floor while the
                    application saves the trips in the elevator “log” excluding the new trip. The save progress can be
                    found at the top right as a progress bar.</p>

            <h2>Implementation</h2>
            <div>
                <h3>Moving The Elevator</h3>
                <figure>
                    <pre>
                        <code>
private void moveElevator(int destination)
{
    if (checkFloor(destination) == true)
    {
        return;
    }

    addTrip(destination);
    isIdle = false;
    isOpening = true;
    elevatorDestination = destination;

    switch (destination)
    {
        case 0:
            btnRequest0.Enabled = false;
            btnRequest1.Enabled = true;
            break;
        case 1:
            btnRequest1.Enabled = false;
            btnRequest0.Enabled = true;
            break;
    }
    updateList();
}
                        </code>
                    </pre>
                </figure>
                <p>
                    One of the main functions of the implementation was the <span>moveElevator</span> function. This
                    would check whether we were already on the destination floor otherwise would add the trip to the
                    events, set the condition of the doors and the destination and would enable or disable the
                    appropriate buttons depending on what floor the elevator is going to. <span>Updatelist</span>
                    would refresh the list box that is shown to the user containing the local dataset.
                </p>

            <div>
                <h3>Loading and Saving</h3>
                <figure>
                    <pre>
                        <code>
private void loadData()
{
    try
    {
        adapter.Fill(ds);
    }
    catch (Exception ex)
    {
        MessageBox.Show(ex.ToString(), "Error", MessageBoxButtons.OK);
    }
}

private void saveToDb()
{
    if (ds.Tables[0].Rows.Count != 0)
    {
        try
        {
            DataSet dataSetChanges = ds.GetChanges();
            adapter.Update(dataSetChanges);
            ds.Tables[0].AcceptChanges();
        }
        catch (Exception ex)
        {
            MessageBox.Show(ex.Message, "Error", MessageBoxButtons.OK);
        }
    }
}
                        </code>
                    </pre>
                </figure>
                <p>
                    Another important area of the application was the loading and saving to and from the database. Here
                    we have the <span>loadData</span> and <span>saveToDb</span> functions which make use of the
                    <span>OleDbDataAdapter</span>’s methods <span>Fill</span>
                    and <span>Update</span>. The application will use <span>Fill</span> to try to load the data from the
                    table in the database
                    into the local dataset. Using <span>GetChanges</span> on the local dataset, the application will try
                    to use
                    <span>Update</span> to build the needed commands to reflect the changes to the data on the database
                    (this is the
                    <span>disconnected model</span>). Upon success, the application will commit these changes.
                </p>

                <h3>Timer and Refresh</h3>
                <figure>
                    <pre>
                        <code>
private void tmr_Tick(Object sender, EventArgs e)
{
    if (!isIdle)
    {
        if (elevatorStatus == 0)
        {
            pan0.Refresh();
        }
        else
        {
            pan1.Refresh();
        }
    }
}

private void pan0_paint(object sender, PaintEventArgs e)
{
    if (isIdle)
    {
        elevatorDoors(pan0);
    }
    else if (isOpening)
    {
        openDoors(pan0);
    }
    else if (isClosing)
    {
        closeDoors(pan0);
    }
}
                        </code>
                    </pre>
                </figure>
                <p>
                    Within the “animation” aspect of the application, we have used a <span>timer</span> and the
                    <span>refresh</span> event of a panel to emulate this effect. The <span>timer</span> will run its
                    <span>tick event</span> periodically after a predetermined amount of time. Once this runs, it will
                    check the current condition of the elevator. If idle, the elevator is not redrawn. If the status is
                    0 or on ground floor then refresh the ground floor panel, otherwise refresh the first floor panel.
                    Note that additional floors can easily be added through the slight modification of conditions like
                    these.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The refresh event will run the <span>paint event handler</span> for the appropriate floor panel. If
                    the elevator is idle, the floor panel is redrawn to draw the doors once. If the doors are opening,
                    the floor panel is redrawn to animate doors opening. If the doors are closing, the floor panel is
                    redrawn to animate the doors closing.
                </p>

                <h3>Background Worker</h3>
                <figure>
                    <pre>
                        <code>
private void backgroundWorker1_DoWork(object sender, DoWorkEventArgs e)

                <p>
                    A final important feature in implementation is the use of the background worker service which allows
                    the application to perform asynchronous operations on a seperate thread. The
                    <span>backgroundworker_DoWork</span> event handler will run when the background worker is set. The
                    event handler will assign a variable <span>arg</span> with the value of the asynchronous operation.
                    If there are any changes to the dataset, alert the user that the application is saving and run
                    <span>saveToDb</span>. Convert the value of <span>arg</span> to percentage and update the progress
                    bar through the <span>ReportProgress</span> event and <span>ProgressChanged</span> event handler.
                    Set the result as <span>arg</span> as operation succeeded which runs the
                    <span>RunWorkerCompleted</span> event handler. If at any point the user cancels, set as cancelled
                    and show save cancelled message.
