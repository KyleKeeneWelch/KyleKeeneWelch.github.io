                <h2>Biography</h2>
            </header>
            <p>
                My name is <strong>Kyle Keene-Welch</strong> and I am currently <strong>20 years old</strong> studying
                at <a href="https://www.beds.ac.uk/"><strong>The University Of Bedfordshire</strong></a> in Luton. I am
                a <strong>junior in my field</strong> who is developing their skills in <strong>Web Development and
                    Software Engineering</strong> with hopes to secure a professional position at a reputable technical
                firm.
            </p>
            <p>
                I grew up locally within <strong>Bedford</strong> where I had a successful education at <a
                    href="https://www.bedfordacademy.co.uk/"><strong>Bedford Academy</strong></a> and <a
                    href="https://bedfordcollegegroup.ac.uk/"><strong>Bedford College</strong></a>. The transition to
                higher education came from my aspirations to further my learning and secure a degree at an accredited
                institution. Since the transition, I have learnt and developed on several skills and concepts relating
                to a wide range of technical subjects with personal emphasis on those I wish to pursue in the future.
            </p>
            <p>
                Alongside my academic development, I also had development in other areas where I was able to progress
                personally. This involved building confidence in areas such as a job where my <strong>experience working
                    at Tesco</strong> provided the responsibilities that pushed me to become an effective worker,
                building professional and casual <strong>relationships between academic figures, professionals in the
                    same network</strong> and <strong>meeting new friends in a new location</strong>, and building
                resilience and grit to overcome obstacles such as <strong>meeting deadlines, consistency at the
                    gym</strong> and <strong>learning to drive</strong>.
            </p>
            <p>
                I am passionate in providing a useful, effective service in the support I provide and I apply myself in
                everything I do, ensuring I am <strong>not only a successful professional</strong> but also a
                <strong>powerful team member</strong> as part of a team working towards a goal. I want to
                <strong>continually learn and adapt to the changing environment</strong> I place myself in and by
                <strong>enhancing my skills and experience in a range of projects</strong>, I can meet this demmand and
                shape myself to become an effective practitioner in a technical field.

                <p>
                    Going to the gym as a hobby is part of my lifestyle which came about due to the personal need to
                    work on my
                    fitness and improve my confidence. The driving factor that enabled me to push myself to go and work
                    on my fitness was due to the negative impacts of isolation after contracting Covid 19 back when it
                    was prevalent. I felt really negative about my health after isolating for over a week and knew I
                    wanted to do something about it so after confirming I was covid free, I sought to create a personal
                    fitness plan and perform some research.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This eventually led to building upon several areas and meeting fitness objectives of which I
                    constantly updated to the point where I am now. Nowadays, I aim to go five days a week and implement
                    two rest days spread about the week and follow a popular push, pull, legs plan.

                <p>
                    Much like the need to improve my health with the gym, performing some casual sports also helped to
                    meet my fitness goals. Sports such as Football, Basketball and the occasional Badminton would enable
                    me to build my cardiovascular endurance as well as enjoying a popular pastime with some friends.

                    The University Of Bedfordshire provides a Get Active program which sponsers students and provides
                    them with an account by which they can book hour sessions of various different sports and
                    activities. Through using this service provided freely as part of my degree, I was able to attend a
                    pre-booked Football, Basketball or Badminton session with friends at a local fitness centre and in
                    my case, this happened to be the same place I attend the gym.

                    Video games are a great way to spend your time when on a recharge after doing some work or as a
                    social activity with some friends. Depending on the game, you can receive several different benefits
                    such as feelings of excitement or thrill, accomplishment and satisfaction, problem solving skills
                    and creativity, and social interaction and cooperation.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I have played a variety of different types of games reaping from many of the benefits much from my
                    childhood and many from the present. Games on services such as the Xbox Game Pass enable me to pay
                    for a subscription to access a catalogue of downloadable games that can be played endlessly as long
                    as the subscription remains active. This means I can pick and choose the kind of experience I want
                    depending on how I feel at the end of the day and I don't have to worry about paying a large expense
                    to try something new.

                <p>
                    I would like to say that supporting others is a best interest of mine that I partake in whether that
                    be technically with my classmates or associates or in general with my friends and those I am in
                    close relationships with.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Some examples might include explaining a particular topic in a way that a classmate might understand
                    as opposed to the point being missed in class, coming to terms in a group project and providing
                    useful assistance, encouraging friends and giving academic advice or doing a household task with the
                    effort to help in the shared flat.
                </p>
                <p>
                    By helping others, I can benefit from the experience gained from the cooperation, team-building and
                    relationships developed. I can offer assistance with hope that others will provide the same
                    generousity back and this is a great quality to maintain to make the world around a better place.

                    Listening to music is a great way to produce several feelings and take part in various cultures. It
                    can be played to heighten the mood and energize or dampen and chill. The variety of music mediums
                    and genres allows a listener to customize their own playing experience and can combine music from
                    diverse sources.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Similarly, listening to podcasts allow me to interpret the opinions and ideas from a range of
                    backgrounds on several academic and technological topics. As a listener I can take on an objective
                    view to base my own thoughts and opinions on controversial topics and can consume the media as an
                    entertaining pastime.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I use music to energize and heighten the mood during my workouts at the gym to keep my mind alert
                    and movements dynamic. It helps to ease off the pressure and work alongside some tunes that aim to
                    keep you on edge. Furthermore, I also use music and podcasts while doing some work as some
                    background noise filling in the atmosphere and to mellow out while doing some problem solving.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Keeping the kind of music and the podcasts I listen to open and exploring different genres and
                    sources allows me to enjoy content from a range of cultures, groups and perspectives. Switching up
                    keeps me engaged and satisfied and it is a great way to utilize the medium to assist in my daily
                    activities.
