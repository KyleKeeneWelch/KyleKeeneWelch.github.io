                <p>I am a <strong>Web Developer / Software Engineer at The University Of Bedfordshire.</strong></p>
                <p>Currently, I have been involved with different technologies with the goal to improve my proficiency
                    in a
                    range of areas in the industry.</p>
                <p>These include languages such as <strong>Python, C#, JavaScript, Dart, PHP, Java</strong>.</p>
                <p>Frameworks such as <strong>ASP.NET, React, Ionic, Django, Flutter</strong>.</p>
                <p>Tools such as <strong>VSCode, GitHub, Notepad++, SQLite, Android Studio</strong>.</p>
                <p>I understand the importance learning has in personal development and how adapting to new advances in
                    the
                    upcoming era of techonolgy will allow me to stay competitive and offer a more useful and efficient
                    service.</p>

                    and

                <h2>More Than Just A Developer</h2>
            </header>
            <div>
                <p>Alongside my duties and learning as a developer, I also take part in several hobbies and contain
                    fulfilling interests that boost my skills and understanding in similar fields. These enable me to
                    enrich
                    my lifestyle and maintain my time outside of my involvement in the industry. Some hobbies and
                    interests
                    that I partake in include:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Being active at the gym</strong> - Setting personal goals and sticking to a routine to
                        meet
                        my fitness aspirations.</li>
                    <li><strong>Casual sports</strong> - Subsidiary activity to assist towards my fitness goals and to
                        provide social benefits from teamwork with others.</li>
                    <li><strong>Video games</strong> - Downtime activity to keep myself engaged and interactions with
                        exciting worlds fuel my creativity.</li>
                    <li><strong>Assisting others in the workfield or social sphere</strong> - Helping others in a field
                        I
                        have competence with whether it be as part of a team or an individual with like-minded goals.
                        Other
                        cases would be friends and family who request a degree of support I can assist with.</li>
                    <li><strong>Listening to a variety of music</strong> - Whether that be quietly on the side while I
                        do my
                        work or playing to keep the energy flowing during a workout at the gym, I am always exploring my
                        options.</li>
