    Biography

  <br>
  <div class="container">
    <p>My name is <strong>Kyle Keene-Welch</strong> and I am currently <strong>20 years old</strong> studying at <a href="https://www.beds.ac.uk/"><strong>The University Of Bedfordshire</strong></a> in Luton. 
      I am a <strong>junior in my field</strong> who is developing their skills in <strong>Web Development and Software Engineering</strong> with hopes to secure a professional position at a reputable technical firm.</p>
    <p>I grew up locally within <strong>Bedford</strong> where I had a successful education at <strong><a href="https://www.bedfordacademy.co.uk/">Bedford Academy</a></strong> and <strong><a href="https://bedfordcollegegroup.ac.uk/">Bedford College</a></strong>. 
      The transition to higher education came from my aspirations to further my learning and secure a degree at an accredited institution. 
      Since the transition, I have learnt and developed on several skills and concepts relating to a wide range of technical subjects with personal emphasis on those I wish to pursue in the future.</p>
    <p>Alongside my academic development, I also had development in other areas where I was able to progress personally. 
      This invovled building confidence in areas such as a job where my <strong>experience working at Tesco</strong> provided the responsibilities that pushed me to become an effective worker, building professional 
      and casual <strong>relationships between academic figures, professionals in the same network</strong> and <strong>meeting new friends in a new location</strong>, and building resilience and grit to overcome obstacles such as <strong>meeting deadlines, consistency at the gym</strong> and <strong>learning to drive</strong>.
    </p>
    <p>
      I am passionate in providing a useful, effective service in the support I provide and I apply myself in everything I do, ensuring I am <strong>not only a successful professional</strong> but also a <strong>powerful team member</strong> as part of a team working towards a goal. 
      I want to <strong>continually learn and adapt to the changing environment</strong> I place myself in and by <strong>enhancing my skills and experience in a range of projects</strong>, I can meet this demmand and shape myself to become an effective practitioner in a technical field.
