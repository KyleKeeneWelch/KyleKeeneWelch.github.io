            <h2>Summary</h2>
            <p>
                This project uses the popular framework by Google <span>Flutter</span> to implement a Mobile Application
                Solution to assist many fitness related problems. ActiGym is a workout planner and log that will help
                you to create or select pre-built workouts to do all while monitoring your sessions and measuring your
                progress.
            </p>
            <p>
                <span>Dart</span> as the official langauge, is used to build several components known as
                <span>widgets</span> which can be used to structure and present key areas. Each <span>widget</span> is
                designed to serve a particular function and the derived order and properties of such
                <span>widgets</span> make up the look and feel of the application to the user. Flutter is used to
                generate natively-compiled applications for multiple platforms including both <span>Android</span> and
                <span>iOS</span>.
            </p>
            <p>
                ActiGym maintains a connection to a <span>MSAccess</span> database of which is used to store and access
                user data including accounts, sessions and workouts. A user is able to create a free account that they
                can use to specify days they plan to go to the gym, create new workouts, edit workouts, start workouts
                or view their performance. The interface allows for easy and convenient access to immediately start a
                workout as well as create and edit workouts to meet individual needs. Users that do not wish for the
                full process and prefer an abstracted experience can start with the pre-built workouts or select to
                perform an unplanned workout which provides only the basic workout components such as the timer.

            <h2>Features</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>MSAccess Database Connectivity</strong> - Application instantiates and populates an MSAccess
                    database and uses related Entity Framework functions to update and get changes to the data and
                    database schema so they are concurrent.</li>
                <li><strong>Create and Edit Workouts</strong> - ActiGym provides an easy interface for creating new and
                    editing existing workouts. Exercises contained within a workout are clearly displayed in a list and
                    the appropriate buttons to modify the workout and included exercises are provided. When suitable, a
                    user can easily start the selected workout.</li>
                <li><strong>Intuitive Workout Execution</strong> - Users are granted with an easy to follow workout
                    execution where they can clearly see the workout they are performing, the current exercise they are
                    on as well as other information such as the number of sets, the set number they are on, previous
                    achieved reps, previous weight and workout notes.</li>
                <li><strong>Performance Tracking</strong> - Provides a session log to see what workouts you have done
                    and when and for how long they lasted. Also provides performance graphs which graphically show your
                    progress on various areas.</li>
                <li><strong>Unplanned and Pre-built Workouts</strong> - Users that don't want to worry about creating
                    their own workouts or want to get straight into a workout can start an unplanned or pre-built
                    workout. Unplanned workouts provide basic functionality to perform and log the workout without
                    indication of exercises and sets. Pre-built workouts are as the name suggests pre-made so that you
                    can stimulate an area or muscle group without worrying about adjusting your own workout.
                </li>
                <li><strong>Profile Picture Modification</strong> - A user with a newly registered account will have
                    their profile picture set as the default anonymous image. Users are able to update this by taking a
                    new photo or accessing one taken from their gallery.</li>

                    Here we can see the graphical user interface showing the register screen. Upon app startup, the user
                    is met with a splash screen with the logo and a loading indicator before reaching the log in page.
                    From here, the user can enter their previously registered details to access their account with
                    ActiGym or can press the "register" button to access a similar page to register. Upon valid data
                    entry, the application will register the user with the database and will reach the home screen.

                    When we reach the My Workouts screen, we are able to create a new workout. We need to specify the
                    name and number of exercises of this workout and then promptly press edit so we can add some new
                    exercises to the created workout. Pressing edit will redirect the user to the Modify Workout screen
                    which displays the current exercises of a selected workout and in this case, there is none. We can
                    add new exercises by filling in the required fields and pressing create exercise. Refreshing the
                    list will show the new workout. We are also able to delete or clear exercises if necessary. To start
                    the exercise, we can either press the start button on the Modify Workout screen or back on the My
                    Workouts screen.

                <p>A created workout or a pre-built workout can be selected and started through the My Workouts or
                    Modify Workout screen. Additionally, an unplanned workout can be started by pressing the button at
                    the bottom of the My Workouts screen. The perform workout screen contains details on the current
                    exercise, the number of sets, highest achived reps and highest achieved reps for that exercise. Any
                    notes written previously are shown when the workout has started and this can be edited. The timer
                    shows the complete time of the workout from the moment the start button is pressed. Each set the
                    user will record by entering the achieved reps and the weight for that set. Once a set has been
                    recorded a rest period is initiated and the user can end this before the end of the countdown by
                    pressing to start next set. Once all sets and exercises have been completed, the user will no longer
                    be able to record a set and will end the workout. For an unplanned workout, a user can do up to 99
                    sets and still have the workout recorded as a session in My Performance.</p>

                <h3>Creating Tables and Connecting to the Database</h3>
                <figure>

                        <code>
class SQLHelper {
    static Future<void> createTables(sql.Database database) async {
    await database.execute("""CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS accounts(
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT NOT NULL,
    username TEXT,
    password TEXT,
    createdAt TIMESTAMP NOT NULL DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
    );
    """);
    
    ...

    static Future<sql.Database> db() async {
        return sql.openDatabase('../database actigym_data.accdb', version: 1,
        onCreate: (sql.Database database, int version) async {
            await createTables(database);
        });
    }

                    </pre>
                </figure>
                <p>
                    Upon initialization, the application will create each of the tables within the database if they have
                    not already been created. These will be created within the <span>SQLHelper</span> class found in a
                    component file named <span>sqlhelper.dart</span>. The file will also contain all the other related
                    database functions that will manipulate the <span>CRUD operations</span> on workouts and exercises
                    as well as queries to get them. This file is imported and each of the database methods avaliable to
                    each of the screens that use them so that they can connect to the database and make insertions and
                    modifcations corresponding to user input.

                <p>
                    Within the implementation, it was often required to send data between screens so that this can be
                    accessed and the right content was displayed to the user. In this case, the current user's ID that
                    is logged into the application is the important piece of data that we need to send across to each
                    screen. The application only knows which workouts to show and what session belongs to what user when
                    it is able to distinguish which user is currently logged in.
                </p>
                <p>
                    To do this, we use the <span>Navigator</span> to push a route to the desired screen along with the
                    parameters with arguments we provide to send the data across. The receiving screen will obtain this
                    and will save this in a variable, in this case <span>currentId</span>, which can be accessed and
                    referenced in code. We can use this for example, to query the workouts belonging to the logged in
                    user by calling the relevant imported database function and passing in the value.

                    Often, it is required to reuse certain colours and design aspects in order to produce a consistent
                    and appealing user interface. Because of this, it became useful to define a theme with clear set out
                    colours, fonts, headlines and other theme data that can be referenced and reused constantly to offer
                    quick access. It is beneficial to use a relative value such as referencing a value stored as part of
                    a theme as if it came required to adjust this, you would only have to make a change in the theme
                    instead of every instance that that value is used in the application.

                    Much of the functionality provided as part of a workout planner and log is found in making queries
                    and updating the database that houses this information. As this is the case, there are many
                    instances where we will utilize the imported database methods from the <span>SQLHelper</span> class
                    to make the required insertion or change.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In the displayed code example above and much like the other instances, we are accessing the method
                    as part of the onPressed event of an elevated button that the user has pressed. The event will
                    trigger an anonymous function which will try to call a database method and pass in the relevant
                    arguments in their correct format as part of the input provided by the user. Upon success, we will
                    update our current data within the screen by getting any workouts or exercises that belong to the
                    logged in user much like we did when we visited the screen. Any input fields are reset to an empty
                    string and the user is informed of the outcome through a displayed snackbar. If there was an error
                    they are also infomed. The changes are reflected when the user presses refresh to update any lists
                    with the collected information.

                    Much of the application relies on content that belongs to a particular user and therefore requires
                    users to have a registered account. This is the case as many screens display dynamic content that
                    depend on the workouts users create and the exercises contained.
                <p>
                    In the provided example, we obtain the exercise that we are going to display to the user as part of
                    the perform workout page. This depends on the workout the user has selected to start and from this,
                    the value passed to the screen that is used to query for the exercises to display. Selecting an
                    unplanned workout would default the value to 10000 and the application will apply the <span>ternary
                        operator</span> to see if this value has been passed, otherwise display the user's started
                    workout information as normal. The information displayed will depend on the name of the exercise the
                    user entered, the number of sets, reps and the achieved weight. Finishing the exercise, taking the
                    rest period, and continuing will update this information to the next exercise in the list of maps
                    returning from the asynchronous database method call.

                    Implementation also included using third party packages such as the syncfusion flutter charts
                    package in order to display our workout data in a responsive, detailed and graphical format.
                    Syncfusion flutter charts allows us to generate a graph using custom data that is mapped to the
                    axis. We can customize and alter certain areas of the graph such as the title, colours used and the
                    axis names to target our users and provide a better performance metric for them to follow.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Our data to be displayed in the graph is sourced through the <span>_updateData</span> method which
                    will obtain the relevant workout exercises to be displayed in the weight per exercise graph when a
                    workout is selected in the list. The graph itself is generated once the data is populated by the
                    database. The class <span>_ChartData</span> will map the provided data to the x and y axis.
