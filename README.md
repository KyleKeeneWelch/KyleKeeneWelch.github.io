These include languages such as **Python, C#, JavaScript, Dart, PHP, Java**. 
Frameworks such as **ASP.NET, React, Ionic, Django, Flutter**.
Tools such as **VSCode, GitHub, Notepad++, SQLite, Android Studio**.
I understand the importance learning has in personal development and how adapting to new advances in the upcoming era of techonolgy will allow me to stay competitive and offer a more useful and efficient service.

Alongside my duties and learning as a developer, I also take part in several hobbies and contain fulfilling interests that boost my skills and understanding in similar fields. These enable me to enrich my lifestyle and maintain my time outside of my involvement in the industry. Some hobbies and interests that I partake in include:
**Being active at the gym** - Setting personal goals and sticking to a routine to meet my fitness aspirations.
**Casual sports** - Subsidiary activity to assist towards my fitness goals and to provide social benefits from teamwork with others.
**Video games** - Downtime activity to keep myself engaged and interactions with exciting worlds fuel my creativity.
**Assisting others in the workfield or social sphere** - Helping others in a field I have competence with whether it be as part of a team or an individual with like-minded goals. Other cases would be friends and family who request a degree of support I can assist with.
**Listening to a variety of music** - Whether that be quietly on the side while I do my work or playing to keep the energy flowing during a workout at the gym, I am always exploring my options.
